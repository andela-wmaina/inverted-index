// First defense feedback
- Asychronously upload files
- Search results should be better displayed with file name and the search terms in a user friendly manner.
- Create Index button is unnecessary and confusing.
- Replace Get index button to Create Index.
- When a user uploads a file it should automatically be generated in the table.
- Get index results should specify the file.
- Fix coverage badge

Tests
- Look at HTML5 file api for asyn
- isJSON function is not to be defined in the test file

- Remove unnecessary spacing and be consitent (one spacing is enough)
- Be consitent with ES6 syntax e.g => and function() should not mix
- Javascript underscore variable are not acceptable
- Use eslint
- Have a better description of tests e.g Populate index should have a created index 


// Second defense feedback
- Users should create index through the create index button
- File should not override the index created. Files should uploaded with the same instance
- inverted-index line 19: es6 concatenation
- Be specific with your regexp, include only the characters you need.
- Check if json has title and text field.
